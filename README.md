# Data Visualization Internship Project -Investment Preferences Analysis
PROJCT OVERVIEW
As part of my internship at Cognifyz Technologies,I worked on a data visualization projct using Microsoft Excel.The dataset analyzed contained diverse columns,including demographic detailes,investment avenues,saving objectives,reasons for investment choices & participants' expectations.This project aimed to extract actionable insights & create an interactive dashboard to present findings in a visually appealing manner.
DATASET DETAILS
The dataset included the following columns:
Demographics: GENDER, AGE
Investment Avenues: MUTUAL_FUNDS, EQUITY_MARKET, DEBENTURES, GOVERNMENT_BONDS, FIXED_DEPOSITS, PPF, GOLD, STOCK_MARKET
Investment Details: FACTOR, OBJECTIVE, PURPOSE, DURATION, INVESTMENT_MONITOR, EXPECT, AVENUE, SAVING OBJECTIVES
Reasons for Choices: REASON_EQUITY, REASON_MUTUAL, REASON_BONDS, REASON_FD
Sources of Information: SOURCE
Tasks and Deliverables
I was assigned the following tasks during the internship:

Analyze the Gender Distribution within the dataset.
Analyze Participants' Investment Preferences, including the distribution across different avenues and the reasons for investment choices.
Examine Savings Objectives and Common Information Sources.
Analyze Investment Durations mentioned by participants and their expectations from investments.
Explore Potential Correlations between factors like Age, Investment Durations, and Expected Returns.
Combine selected visualizations into an interactive dashboard using slicers and charts.
Visualizations Created
The following visualizations were developed to present insights from the dataset:

Gender Distribution Analysis:

Visualization: Pie Chart
Insight: The dataset is distributed among male and female participants, with males constituting the majority.
Distribution Across Investment Avenues:

Visualization: Bar Chart
Insight: Fixed Deposits and Mutual Funds emerged as the most popular investment avenues.
Reasons for Investment Choices:

Visualization: Stacked Bar Chart
Insight: Reasons varied significantly by avenue, with "low risk" being the primary factor for Fixed Deposits, while "high returns" attracted participants to Equity Markets.
Savings Objectives:

Visualization: Donut Chart
Insight: Retirement savings and children's education were the most common objectives.
Frequency of Information Sources:

Visualization: Horizontal Bar Chart
Insight: Financial advisors and online platforms were the most common sources of investment information.
Investment Durations:

Visualization: Histogram
Insight: Most participants preferred short-term investments, with durations ranging between 1–5 years.
Participants' Expectations:

Visualization: Radar Chart
Insight: Participants prioritized "capital preservation" and "moderate returns" as their primary expectations.
Potential Correlations:

Visualization: Scatter Plot (not included in the dashboard)
Insight: No significant linear correlation was observed between age, investment durations, and expected returns.
Relationship Between Durations and Expectations:

Visualization: Bubble Chart (not included in the dashboard)
Insight: Investment durations showed diverse expectations but no visible trends.
Interactive Dashboard
The dashboard was designed to present key insights effectively while allowing for interactivity. It included the following:

Visualizations in the Dashboard:
Pie Chart: Gender Distribution Analysis.
Bar Chart: Distribution of Participants Across Investment Avenues.
Stacked Bar Chart: Reasons for Investment Choices.
Histogram: Distribution of Investment Durations.
Donut Chart: Distribution of Savings Objectives.
Radar Chart: Different Expectations of Participants.
Dynamic KPIs:
Total Number of Participants
Average Age
Number of Male Participants
Number of Female Participants
Slicers:
Gender
Investment Avenues
Expected Returns
The slicers made the dashboard interactive, enabling users to filter data dynamically for deeper insights.

Key Insights
Demographics: Male participants outnumbered females significantly, highlighting a potential gender disparity in investment behaviors.
Investment Preferences: Fixed Deposits and Mutual Funds were the most preferred avenues, with "low risk" and "moderate returns" being the key drivers.
Savings Objectives: Retirement savings and children's education emerged as the top financial goals for participants.
Investment Durations: Short-term investments (1–5 years) dominated the dataset, indicating participants' preference for liquidity.
Expectations: Participants valued capital preservation and moderate returns over high-risk investments.
